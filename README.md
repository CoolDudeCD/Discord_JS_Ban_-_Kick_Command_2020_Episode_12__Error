# Discord JS Ban and Kick Command 2020 Episode 12 - 1:45 Error
This is all of my code all the way up to Worn Off Key's'Discord JS Ban and Kick Command (2020) [Episode #12]' video. I'm up to 1:45. When I go to run the bot, I get an error message. I run the 'node --trace-warnings ...; and I get 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND'. (This can found here: https://pastebin.com/kqwpEQSc) 

NOTE: This GitHub repository contains all of my code (excluding config.json, node_modules etc.) that has been covered in Worn Off Key's Videos.
